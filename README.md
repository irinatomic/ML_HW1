# Machine learning - homework 1
This is the first homework assignment for a university course on Machine Learning.
It consists of 4 tasks:

1. Theoretical Questions
2. Linear Regression
3. kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)
4. Cleaning text data, **Naive-Bayes classification**, calculating LR (Likelihood Ratio) values, and analyzing disaster tweets 

Further explanation for each task is provided in the corresponding Python notebooks.

## Datasets
1. Linear Regression: 'bottle.csv' dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sohier/calcofi?select=bottle.csv).
2. kNN: 'iris.csv' dataset available [here](/data/iris.csv).
3. Naive-Bayes: 'train.csv', addresed in the code as 'disaster-tweets.csv', available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data?select=train.csv).
